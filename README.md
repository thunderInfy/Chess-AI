# Chess-AI
This repository ultimately aims to build a Chess-AI.

You would need Processing (click here to download it - https://processing.org/download/) to run this project in your system.

Things done:
  - Created a basic UI for chess AI (coded our initial chess board).

Things To Do:
  - Efficient Board visualization.
  - Code chess rules.
  - An evaluation function for the board. It is supposed to be fast and a good heuristic.
  - The core AI algorithm, minimax.
  - Alpha beta pruning minimax optimization.
